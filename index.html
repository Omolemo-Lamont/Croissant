        ü•ê Croissant Recipe
    </h1>
    <p class="introduction">The Process
        <br />
        <strong> Bloom the yeast:</strong> In the bowl of a mixer, add the warm milk, brown sugar, yeast and stir it
        with a fork slightly.
        Let it
        stand for about 5 minutes. If the yeast is good, the mixture will get all foamy as the yeast dissolves. It could
        take a
        bit longer but if your yeast does not dissolve, see recipe notes.
        <br />
        <strong>Make the dough:</strong> Add the flour and salt to the bowl. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed for
        about 5 minutes
        until the
        dough is smooth and very soft. I used about 3 1/4 cups of flour, but if you need more because the dough is too
        sticky
        than just add more, about 1 tbsp at a time. You might want to start with 3 cups and add as needed. Remove the
        dough from
        the mixing bowl and knead for a couple more minutes on your working surface. The dough needs to be soft and
        slightly
        sticky. Place the dough back in the bowl, wrap it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for an hour.
        <br />
        <strong>Prepare the butter:</strong> While the dough is chilling, prepare the butter. Arrange the sticks of
        butter horizontally
        on a
        piece of plastic wrap. Cover the butter with another piece of plastic wrap. Pound and roll out on both sides
        until the
        butter forms a nice 8 by 5 inch rectangle. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.
        <br />
        <strong>Laminate the dough:</strong> Flour your work surface lightly then roll out the dough into a big
        rectangle that‚Äôs about 16
        by 10
        inches. Place the butter directly in the center of the dough and fold the dough as you would a letter, bottom
        third of
        dough over butter, then top third down over the dough. If you have any excess flour, make sure you brush that
        off.
        Turn the dough so that the short side is nearest you and start rolling it another 16 by 10 inch rectangle. Fold
        in
        thirds like a letter again. This was the first fold. Wrap it up in plastic wrap and chill it for another hour.
        <br />
        <strong>Repeat as above</strong>. With the short side near you, start rolling until you get another 16 by 10
        inch rectangle. Fold
        it in
        thirds again, wrap and chill for another hour. Repeat this 3 more times so that it will make a total of 5 folds.
        After
        the last fold, refrigerate it over night or at least for 8 hours.
        <br />
        <strong>Shape croissants:</strong> Cut the dough in half, freeze half if you‚Äôre only going to use half of it.
        Roll out each piece
        of
        dough into a long rectangle, so that it‚Äôs about 1/4 of an inch in thickness. I found it easier if I cut the
        piece into 3
        pieces, so that I work with 3 squares. Using a pizza cutter, cut each square into 4 triangles.
        Using one triangle at a time, start rolling from the wide side, at the same time, stretching the end of the
        triangle.
        Continue rolling the croissant, and as you‚Äôll notice because you stretched into a long piece, you‚Äôll be able to
        roll the
        croissant a few times.
        Repeat this with remaining dough and place the croissants on an ungreased baking sheet, with about 1 to 2 inches
        in
        between them.
        Let the croissants sit for another hour, you‚Äôll notice they‚Äôll rise a bit, then brush them with egg wash. You
        can make
        the croissants ahead of time and refrigerate them for up to 18 hours before baking. If you‚Äôre making them ahead,
        make
        sure to cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap.
        <br />
        <strong>Bake croissants:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400 F degrees. Place the baking sheet in the oven and
        bake the croissants
        for 8 to
        12 minutes at 400 F degrees then turn down the heat to 375 F degrees and bake them for another 8 to 12 minutes.
        You want
        to make sure they are nice and golden brown.

    <p class="introduction">In the mood for something on the savory side?
        <br />
        Croissants make fabulous breakfast sandwiches. Here are some ideas
        for
        what to include in your breakfast sandwich‚Äîpick your favorites!

        Fried egg
        Scrambled egg‚ÄîTry adding some garlic powder and chives for extra flavor. Don‚Äôt forget salt and pepper!
        Your favorite cheese‚ÄîWe like sharp cheddar, Gruyere, and gouda.
        Bacon
        Sausage
        Canadian bacon or ham
        Greens, such as spinach or chard (chard is eggcellent when fried up in your extra bacon fat with some salt and
        pepper!)
        Tomatoes
        Avocado
        Hot sauce
        A drizzle of honey or maple syrup
        We recommend toasting your croissant in the oven for about a minute before piling all the goodness on. If you‚Äôre
        using
        cheese, put that on your croissant first and then broil to melt and toast.
