        ü•ê Croissant Recipe
    </h1>
    <p>The Process
        <br />
        make easy dough from butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk
        roll out dough into a large rectangle
        make the butter layer (I have an easy trick for this!!!)
        enclose the butter layer inside the dough
        roll out the dough into another large rectangle, then fold it back together
        roll out the dough again, fold it back together again
        roll out the dough one more time, fold it back together
        shape the croissants
        bake

    <p>In the mood for something on the savory side?
        <br />
        Croissants make fabulous breakfast sandwiches. Here are some ideas
        for
        what to include in your breakfast sandwich‚Äîpick your favorites!

        Fried egg
        Scrambled egg‚ÄîTry adding some garlic powder and chives for extra flavor. Don‚Äôt forget salt and pepper!
        Your favorite cheese‚ÄîWe like sharp cheddar, Gruyere, and gouda.
        Bacon
        Sausage
        Canadian bacon or ham
        Greens, such as spinach or chard (chard is eggcellent when fried up in your extra bacon fat with some salt and
        pepper!)
        Tomatoes
        Avocado
        Hot sauce
        A drizzle of honey or maple syrup
        We recommend toasting your croissant in the oven for about a minute before piling all the goodness on. If you‚Äôre
        using
        cheese, put that on your croissant first and then broil to melt and toast.
